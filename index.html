<p> HI!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<br>
   
1. "Sisters are the best kind of friends - there's no friend like a sister."   
    <br>
2.    "She is my sounding board, my confidante, my keeper of secrets - and my best friend."
    <br>
3.    "She's always there for me when I need her; She's my best friend; she's just my everything."
    <br>
4.    Words that describe you: my wise sister, my confidant, and my best friend.
    <br>
5.   Sisters are best friends, they are advisors, they are teachers, and best of all they are people with whom you can talk with about anything - someone you have a special bond with!"
    <br>
6.   "A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit, a golden thread to the meaning of life."
    <br>
7.    It is to be treasured when sisters are close or best friends, and what a loss for both of them when they aren't.    
    <br>
8.    One of the best things about being an adult is the realization that you can share with your sister and still have plenty for yourself.
    <br>
9.    "Sister you were the one I always told on, now you're the friend I always lean on. I count my blessings everyday for you."
    <br>
10.    "Sister we don't know what the future holds but we always know we are there for each other."
         <br>
